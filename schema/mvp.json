These characters were developed through rounds of interviews with people from various backgrounds and situations, allowing us to craft out a simulation that portrays similar events faced. Subsequently, Soristic has been improving the simulation by introducing more new characters as well as conducting workshops."

Just because somebody appears more resilient does not mean that they are doing okay."
